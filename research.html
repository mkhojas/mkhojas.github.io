                    <h3> </h3>
                    <p>Unmanned vehicles promise to transform many aspects of our lives, including transportation,
                        agriculture, mining, and construction. Successful use of robot autonomy in these areas depends
                        critically on the ability of robots to adapt safely to changing operational conditions.
                        Recent advances in <b>machine learning</b> have inspired a new major
                        research direction where learning-enabled planning and control can accomplish complex tasks that
                        had been
                        intractable in the past. Two critical considerations for applying these techniques onboard
                        autonomous systems remain: <b>learning online</b>, relying on streaming data, and guaranteeing
                        <b>safe operation</b>, despite the uncertainty of learning algorithms.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Given streaming observations of the system state, we use Bayesian learning to obtain a
                        distribution
                        over the robot dynamics. In turn, the distribution is used to optimize the system behavior and
                        ensure safety with high probability.</p>

                    <p>We pay special attention to the following issues.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p> Robots operating in real-world settings must navigate and maintain safety while
                                interacting with many <b>heterogeneous</b> agents and obstacles. <b>Reinforcement
                                    learning</b> methods have emerged recently, which directly learn actions in
                                <b>multi-agent</b> settings in response to the observed environment. However, these
                                methods provide no formal guarantees of <b>safety</b>. The proposed learning-enabled
                                optimization-based controller prevents the robots from entering unsafe sets in a
                                minimally invasive fashion by projecting desired actions to the closest safe action.
                            <p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><b>Safe exploratory planning</b> is a key yet challenging problem in many engineering
                                domains, such as Mars rover exploration and delivery drones. In context, a robot is used
                                to explore an environment with an unknown, state-dependent disturbance function while
                                avoiding some forbidden areas. A novel framework to solve such uncertainty-aware safe
                                exploratory problems by combining neural control
                                contraction metric with Gaussian
                                process is proposed.

                    <p><b>Quantum engineering</b> is a rapidly growing field that
                        seeks to utilize quantum dynamical systems to perform <b>sensing</b>,
                        <b>communication</b>, or <b>computation</b> by exploiting the unique resources of quantum
                        mechanics. The success of
                        many quantum devices is dependent on precise control of their dynamics.

                    <p>
                        We attempt to bridge the gap between <b>learning</b>
                        and <b>control</b> for quantum systems. By not relying on
                        manually-designed models, which can be brittle, our method
                        will account for the complexity of real-world applications.
                        We utilize a hierarchical design
                        that layers quantum state tomography, quantum process tomography, and Hamiltonian
                        learning to identify the Hamiltonians. In turn, the learned Hamiltonians is utilized to
                        formalize <b>data-driven optimization-based</b> quantum control techniques.</p>

                    <h3> </h3>
                    <p>The distributed nature of cyber-physical systems and cloud
                        robotics is their Achilles' heel, as it is a source of vulnerability to cyber-attacks. We
                        concentrate on an important class of attacks called the "man-in-the-middle" (MITM) and
                        introduce the problem of <b>learning-based attacks</b> in these systems. The attacker attempts
                        to learn the dynamics of the plant
                        and subsequently overrides the controller's actuation signal to destroy the plant without being
                        detected. The
                        controller, on the other hand, is constantly on the lookout for an attack. We show how the
                        controller can impede these attacks by superimposing a carefully crafted
                        <b>privacy-enhancing</b> signal upon its
                        control policy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This project is a complement to learning-based approaches for control as we assume the
                        controller has
                        perfect knowledge of the system dynamics and tries to discover
                        the attack from its observations.
                        The attacker, on the other hand, attempts to learn the system and then destroy it. The assumed
                        information-pattern imbalance
                        between the controller and the attacker is justified since the controller is tuned for a much
                        longer time.

                    <h3> </h3>
                    <p>Recent technological advances in networking, communication, and computation technologies have
                        enabled the development of cyber-physical systems and cloud robotics, where
                        computing, communication, and control are tightly coupled and integrated into a single
                        distributed platform. In most of these systems, the feedback
                        loop is closed over a communication channel. In this context, we study <b>event-triggering</b>
                        strategies that utilize timing information
                        by transmitting in a state-dependent fashion. Compared to the conventional time-triggering
                        setups, the proposed event-triggering strategies utilize the
                        available communication resources more efficiently.</p>
